Sample_Code
===========
This repository contains three different coding projects I have completed either as class projects, or on my own time.

1. Hangman game - Python: <br />
    This is a project I completed on my own time. I wanted to code a fun little game played right in the terminal and experiment with some python code, so I came up with this idea and brought it to life while learning some interesting things about python. <br />
How to run: <br />
    In the terminal, once you are in the directory with the three .py files and the three .txt files, just simply type "python main.py". 
    
2. Inverted Index Search Tool - C: <br />

3. Simplified Version of the Solitaire Encryption Algorithm - Java: <br />
