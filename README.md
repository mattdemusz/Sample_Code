Sample_Code
===========
This repository contains three different coding projects I have completed either as class projects, or on my own time.

1.  Hangman game - Python:  
    
    This is a project I completed on my own time. I wanted to code a fun little game played right in the terminal and experiment with some python code, so I came up with this idea and brought it to life while learning some interesting things about python.

How to run:
    In the terminal, once you are in the directory with the three .py files and the three .txt files, just simply type "python main.py".
